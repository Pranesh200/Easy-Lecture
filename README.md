# Easy-Lectures
### VTHacks7 Project

We've all been there. You slept in an missed your favorite class, McQuain's 2505 lecture. Fear no more.
_Easy Lectures_ makes it easy to catch up on what you missed. We collect videos of lectures and allow you to search through the video to quickly find what you're looking for. Oh, and we almost forgot to mention we have a live chat so that you can ask TA's for help from anywhere- no more travelling to the lounge just to stand in line.

We're using Google's Storage to host our lecture videos, Google's Firestore as our NoSQL database, Google's Compute Engine to host our server, and Google Speech to transcribe the lectures. We used Domain.com to get
[easylectures.online](http://easylectures.online) so feel free to check out our project. Log in with guest@vt.edu and leave the password field blank.
