# Easy-Lectures

Democratizes education by providing accessible lectures with keyword searches and live chats with TA's. Enables easy uploads for users to contribute content to all of their courses. The live chat allows a user to interact with their instructors and TAs over instant communication and can reference lectures on the same page.
